As a consequence, many fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics may be reduced to questions about set theory."

The most pressing consideration, however, is the discovery, made around 1900, of various paradoxes in naive, intuitive set theory, which admits the existence of sets of objects having any definite property whatsoever. Some particular restricted axiomatic approach is needed to avoid these paradoxes."

    "In his initial development of set theor, Canotr did not work explicitly from axioms. However, analysis of his proofs indicates that almost all of the theorems proved by him can be derived from three axioms (1) The axiom of extensionality for sets, which asserts that two sets are identical if they have the same members, (2) the axiom of abstraction, which states that given any property there exists a set whose members are just those entities having that property; (3) the axiom of choice, which will not be formulated at this point and is not pertinent to our discussion of the paradoxes.\n",
